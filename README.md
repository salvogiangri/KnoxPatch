## KnoxPatch Enhancer

KnoxPatch Enhancer is a [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) module that will take care of the (currently) non-fixable apps/features via the Xposed API's, such as the Galaxy Wearable apps. To install it, download the module zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/BlackMesa123/KnoxPatch/releases/latest) and install it from the "Modules" tab inside the Magisk Manager app. The app will then show an "Enhanced" badge if the module is installed and active:
